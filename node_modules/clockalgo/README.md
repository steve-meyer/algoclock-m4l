# clockalgo.js

Generative clock algorithm library.

## About

This JavaScript library is intended for use in Web Audio projects or other audio programming environments such as Max/MSP's Node for Max system. It is currently a work in progress and under active development.

### General Principles

* A musical clock in electronic music is like a metronome that provides a steady pulse marking the passage of time. 
* An algorithmic clock is a repeating pattern of pulses/gates
  * The pattern itself may not consist of evenly spaced beats/pulses
  * At a macro level, the pattern itself will repeat
* A generative, algorithmic clock is one in which multiple patterns can be combined and act on each other

## Inspiration

This code is inspired by the description of [clockalgo by Rian Treanor in a DJ Mag article](https://djmag.com/longreads/studio-selections-rian-treanor).
